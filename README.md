File upload vulnerability occurs when a web application allows file uploads without properly validating the type, content, or size of the uploaded file. The absence of validation allows attackers to upload malicious scripts, i.e., PHP shells or other executable code, that can be run on the server. Upon execution, these scripts can grant unauthorized access, arbitrary code execution, data theft, defacement, or full system compromise. Arbitrary file upload allows attackers to upload scripts, i.e., PHP, JavaScript, or shell files, as images. Server-side validation is necessary because attackers can bypass client-side restrictions easily using tools such as Burp Suite. Arbitrary code execution is accomplished when a malicious file is uploaded on the server and then accessed via a URL, and it allows attackers to run commands on the server directly.
